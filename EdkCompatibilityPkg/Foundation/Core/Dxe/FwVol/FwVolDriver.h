/*++

Routine Description:
    Given the input key, search for the next matching file in the volume.

Arguments:
    This          -   Indicates the calling context.
    FileType      -   FileType is a pointer to a caller allocated
                      EFI_FV_FILETYPE. The GetNextFile() API can filter it's
                      search for files based on the value of *FileType input.
                      A *FileType input of 0 causes GetNextFile() to search for
                      files of all types.  If a file is found, the file's type
                      is returned in *FileType.  *FileType is not modified if
                      no file is found.
    Key           -   Key is a pointer to a caller allocated buffer that
                      contains implementation specific data that is used to
                      track where to begin the search for the next file.
                      The size of the buffer must be at least This->KeySize
                      bytes long. To reinitialize the search and begin from
                      the beginning of the firmware volume, the entire buffer
                      must be cleared to zero. Other than clearing the buffer
                      to initiate a new search, the caller must not modify the
                      data in the buffer between calls to GetNextFile().
    NameGuid      -   NameGuid is a pointer to a caller allocated EFI_GUID.
                      If a file is found, the file's name is returned in
                      *NameGuid.  *NameGuid is not modified if no file is
                      found.
    Attributes    -   Attributes is a pointer to a caller allocated
                      EFI_FV_FILE_ATTRIBUTES.  If a file is found, the file's
                      attributes are returned in *Attributes. *Attributes is
                      not modified if no file is found.
    Size          -   Size is a pointer to a caller allocated UINTN.
                      If a file is found, the file's size is returned in *Size.
                      *Size is not modified if no file is found.

Returns:    
    EFI_SUCCESS                 - Successfully find the file.
    EFI_DEVICE_ERROR            - Device error.
    EFI_ACCESS_DENIED           - Fv could not read.
    EFI_NOT_FOUND               - No matching file found.
    EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       - Invalid parameter

                          contains the type of file read.  This output reflects
                          the file type irrespective of the value of the
                          SectionType input.

                          allocated UINTN in which the authentication status
                          is returned.
Returns:
