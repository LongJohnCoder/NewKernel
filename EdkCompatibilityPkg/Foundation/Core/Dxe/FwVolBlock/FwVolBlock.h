Module Name:

  FwVolBlock.h

Abstract:

  Firmware Volume Block protocol..  Consumes FV hobs and creates
  appropriate block protocols.

  Also consumes NT_NON_MM_FV envinronment variable and produces appropriate
  block protocols fro them also... (this is TBD)

Routine Description:
  The EraseBlock() function erases one or more blocks as denoted by the 
variable argument list. The entire parameter list of blocks must be verified
prior to erasing any blocks.  If a block is requested that does not exist 
within the associated firmware volume (it has a larger index than the last 
block of the firmware volume), the EraseBlock() function must return
EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER without modifying the contents of the firmware volume.

Arguments:
  This - Calling context
  ...  - Starting LBA followed by Number of Lba to erase. a -1 to terminate
           the list.
    
Returns:
  EFI_SUCCESS   -  The erase request was successfully completed.
  EFI_ACCESS_DENIED   -  The firmware volume is in the WriteDisabled state.
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR    -  The block device is not functioning correctly and could not be
                         written. The firmware device may have been partially erased.
