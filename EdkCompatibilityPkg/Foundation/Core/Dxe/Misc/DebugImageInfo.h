CoreInitializeDebugImageInfoTable (
  VOID

/*++

Routine Description:

  Creates and initializes the DebugImageInfo Table.  Also creates the configuration
  table and registers it into the system table.

Arguments:
  None

Returns:
  NA

Notes:
  This function allocates memory, frees it, and then allocates memory at an
  address within the initial allocation. Since this function is called early
  in DXE core initialization (before drivers are dispatched), this should not
  be a problem.

VOID
CoreUpdateDebugTableCrc32 (
  VOID
  )
/*++

Routine Description:

  Update the CRC32 in the Debug Table.
  Since the CRC32 service is made available by the Runtime driver, we have to
  wait for the Runtime Driver to be installed before the CRC32 can be computed.
  This function is called elsewhere by the core when the runtime architectural
  protocol is produced.

Arguments:
  None

Returns:
  NA

CoreNewDebugImageInfoEntry (

  EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle
  )
/*++

Routine Description:

  Adds a new DebugImageInfo structure to the DebugImageInfo Table.  Re-Allocates
  the table if it's not large enough to accomidate another entry.

Arguments:

  ImageInfoType     - type of debug image information
  LoadedImage       - pointer to the loaded image protocol for the image being loaded
  ImageHandle       - image handle for the image being loaded

Returns:
  NA

VOID
CoreRemoveDebugImageInfoEntry (
  EFI_HANDLE ImageHandle

/*++

Routine Description:

  Removes and frees an entry from the DebugImageInfo Table.

Arguments:

  ImageHandle       - image handle for the image being unloaded

Returns:

  NA
