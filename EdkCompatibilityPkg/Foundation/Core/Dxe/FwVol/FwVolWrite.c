    Returns:
      EFI_SUCCESS                   - Files successfully written to firmware volume
      EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES          - Not enough buffer to be allocated.
      EFI_DEVICE_ERROR              - Device error.
      EFI_WRITE_PROTECTED           - Write protected.
      EFI_NOT_FOUND                 - Not found.
