Routine Description:

  Introduces a fine-grained stall.

Arguments:

  Microseconds      The number of microseconds to stall execution

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS            - Execution was stalled for at least the requested amount
                           of microseconds.

  EFI_NOT_AVAILABLE_YET  - gMetronome is not available yet
