Abstract: 
  OEM Status Code report worker.

Revision History:

Bug 2517:   Create the Module StatusCodeHandler to report status code to 
            all supported devide in ByoModule
TIME:       2011-7-22
$AUTHOR:    Liu Chunling
$REVIEWERS:  
$SCOPE:     All Platforms
$TECHNICAL:  
  1. Create the module StatusCodeHandler to support Serial Port, Memory, Port80,
     Beep and OEM devices to report status code.
  2. Create the Port80 map table and the Beep map table to convert status code 
     to code byte and beep times.
  3. Create new libraries to support status code when StatusCodePpi,
     StatusCodeRuntimeProtocol, SmmStatusCodeProtocol has not been installed yet.

  Convert status code value and write data to OEM.

  @param  PeiServices      An indirect pointer to the EFI_PEI_SERVICES table published by the PEI Foundation.
  @param  CodeType         Indicates the type of status code being reported.
  @param  Value            Describes the current status of a hardware or
                           software entity. This includes information about the class and
                           subclass that is used to classify the entity as well as an operation.
                           For progress codes, the operation is the current activity.
                           For error codes, it is the exception.For debug codes,it is not defined at this time.
  @param  Instance         The enumeration of a hardware or software entity within
                           the system. A system may contain multiple entities that match a class/subclass
                           pairing. The instance differentiates between them. An instance of 0 indicates
                           that instance information is unavailable, not meaningful, or not relevant.
                           Valid instance numbers start with 1.
  @param  CallerId         This optional parameter may be used to identify the caller.
                           This parameter allows the status code driver to apply different rules to
                           different callers.
  @param  Data             This optional parameter may be used to pass additional data.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS      Status code reported successfully.
